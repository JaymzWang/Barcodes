Barcodes
========

.Net project that will generate a range of barcodes. The barcodes can be used & integrated into your project however you want.

Currently supports:

  * Code 3 of 9 (Standard & full ASCII)
  * Code 2 of 5
  * Code 11
  * Code128
  * Code93
  * Codabar
  * Code 2 of 7
  * Interleaved 2 of 5
  * EAN13
  * EAN8
  * UPC-A
  * UPC2
  * UPC5
  * UPCE
  * PostNet?
  * CPC (Canadian Post Office codes)
  * US Post Office Intelligent Mail Codes
  
More to be added over time including 3D barcodes like PDF417 & Data Matrix & the 4 state barcodes used by post offices.

I'm also aiming to add GS1 Databar as soon as I get hold of the standard
